# VendingMachine
Junior Design Project 3

The code in this repository can be used to test a vending machine with an automatic door opener and coin detector. The .f3d files are models of the vending machine enclosure, and the testcode file can be used to run a simple program to test the basic functionality of a vending machine with user-inputted values. The other Code files were written in Arduino for testing.
